__**Generic raid rules (DO NOT SKIM THROUGH THIS. READ IT CAREFULLY)**__
Raid dates and times. __**Monday - Wednesday. 20:00 - 23:00 Server time.**__
Be online __**at 19:45**__ for invites.
Heroic re-clear, sundays, 19:00-22:00ST, it is optional. But it's also a great time for getting titanforged pieces and maybe that one azerite piece that keeps evading you! (Usually we are done in two hours, but
if you are signed up for this it would be great if you could stay until Ghuun is 6ft under)

Attendance. 90% Required (ideally missing one out of ten raids, is not a big issue). If you have in real life issues preventing you from coming a certain raid night, you will ALWAYS contact an officer or guildmaster and make sure they know that you're away for this specific night.
If you do not contact either of us in time, preferably a few days beforehand or there may be consequences coming your way.
As a raider you should always aim to be online a few minutes before invites are going out, so you can make sure that you come fully prepared. That means, best in slot enchants, gems, food, potions and flasks. On progression raids the guild will supply feasts and cauldrons, but you should always have food of your desired stat and flasks for three hours(minimum).

You should always bring your A-game for our raiding nights, strive to be the best. Be on the top, but do so, following tactics, if they are neglected and are causing trouble, we will know. Your raiding spot is never permanent, if you do not better yourself after frequent mishaps and mess-ups, you will be investigated and actions will be made accordingly.
(But we will always let you know if major changes are coming your way!)

Sim yourself! Do it! It doesn't take long at all, and you get some accurate knowledge on which gear pieces benefit you the most! If you by any chance are unfamiliar with simcrafting/raidbots, feel free to hit up any of our officers to get some insight and useful information on how it is done.
Read up on tactics, watch videos of the boss fights, it's not the raid leaders job to guide you through it all. The raidleader is basicly a guiding voice, pointing you in the right direction and keeping track of timers. Doing call outs. If you can, try to find a video that shows you your class specific point of view! If you are a melee class, it might not be most beneficial to watch a ranged PoV of a fight. Cause mechanics & tactics do differ slightly on certain fights depending if you're melee or ranged. If by any means, you were to struggle on a boss we're progressing on, do not hesitate to ask for help or advices. By helping you, we are also helping ourselves. We are a team, not just twenty individuals doing their own gigs. A team functions most properly when all the members are synchronized and synergized .


__**Trial raider rules (DO NOT SKIM THROUGH THIS. READ IT CAREFULLY)**__
Raid dates and times. __**Monday - Wednesday. 20:00 - 23:00 Server time.**__
Be online at __**19:45**__ for invites.
Heroic re-clear, sundays, 19:00-22:00ST, it is optional. But it's also a great time for getting titanforged pieces and maybe that one azerite piece that keeps evading you!  (Usually we are done in two hours, but if you are signed up for this it would be great if you could stay until Ghuun is 6ft under)

As a trial, you will be on trial for three weeks minimum. Attendance required is being here for at least five out of six raids. Raid invites start at 19.45 server time, it is expected of you to be online before or by that time. And fully prepared. You are expected to bring your own food, flasks, potions, best in slot enchants and gems. Be simmed and ready for raiding.

Preformance wise, we do not expect miracles from you. But we expect you to do your part
and fully push yourself to the limit. Being exceptional is nothing bad, it's good for both
you and us. Don't be afraid to show what you're capable of!

The big question that is always on everyones mind, the loot.
You will not be rolling on loot that is needed for current members
with the Uldir raider rank. The reason for this is so we do not shove
a whole lots of gear on to you, and you might just quit playing before
making it into the team. Or that you're not what we're looking for.
Your own loot however, if tradable, would be prefered as a rollout
(especially if it's not an upgrade. You can sim yourself without equipping
said item).
But in the end, that is one thing that we cannot control. Although,
it shows good manners and responsibility towards the guild if you were
to rollout self-dropped items from the raid, while you are here as a trial.
It's never a bad thing to improve ones standing with the guild you're
applying to.
